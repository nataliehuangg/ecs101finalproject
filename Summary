While first approaching the problem we decided to make some conclusions about what the score would have to equal to win with zero turns left. If the score was greater than or equal to 1, you win and if it was less than or equal to 0 you lost. We later used these as our base cases. We also made the conclusion that because a high score does not matter, you only have to use quarters when the absolute value of score is greater than the amount of turns left, in order to have a more likely shot of making your score positive before your turns run out. 

The approach we decided to take first to solve the problem was to use a recursion function in Python. We knew we had to have a base case and so we used an if statement setting the values of all scores when turns left equaled 0 to a certain amount. Our recursive step was to use the else statement to call the same function but with score = score-1 or score +1 for dimes and for score = score-2 or score + 2 for quarters, and to have that run through the function until it reached our base case. This part of the process did not work for us. Due to our groupâ€™s lack of experience with Python, we decided to take what we had already figured out and put it into an excel file. Here we implemented the algorithm in one section with dimes and the other section with quarters. In each cell there is a case of score,turns left (column, row). For dimes the algorithm 0.5*(s-1,t-1)+0.5(s+1,t-1) was implemented because with s, t you had a 50% chance of getting s-1,t -1 and a 50% chance of getting s+1, t-1.

(S-1,t-1) = the column to the left one, the row up one
(s+1, t-1) = the column to the right one, the row up one

For quarters, the same algorithm was used the same way, except for score -2 and +2 was used instead of 1, due to the way the points work in the game. 
The max(% for dime, % for quarters) was used in sheet 2, which gave us insight on when we should flip a dime and when we should flip a quarter. Some patterns that we recognized was that at score 0 and 1, every other turn there is a 50% chance of winning for flipping dimes and at score -1, 0, 1, and 2, every other turn there is a 50% chance of winning for flipping quarters.
